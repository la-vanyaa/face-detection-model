Face Detection Model 

This project is still in  progress. 
Here I am using react js and clarifai API model to detect the face of people even if they are in the group. 

To load this model in your computer, you need to generate you API key from clarifai and need to put in the file app.js ( under the command metadata.set - line 11) 
Create a folder called faceAPI and install the react these commands (type in gitbash/vs code terminal or the terminal of your computer after going to the location of this file) 

1) npx create-react-app Faceapi

2)cd faceapi

3)npm start

After the react app is installed, go to the src folder and replace all the files with the src files of the faceAPI project. 

Go to the gitbash(vs code terminal/ terminal) again and type npm start and on the browser the project will be started. 



(PS : The project is facing some glitch and hence not in the proper functioning condition, also it is to be completed fully )
